# About me 
I am Wu Minghua, a research assistant at BLC lab of PolyU, with a master's degree in **Linguistics** from Peking University, China.

My interests focus on the **computational and cognitive** aspects of language. I have experience in neural language models and neural experimental approaches, such as EEG and fMRI. 

I am looking for a Phd position to investigate how langugae is processed and acquired in human brains by combining both machine learning models and neuroimaging methods.

To achieve such goal, I have been learning programming and cognitive science by myself. This blog is built to track my academic progress. 

Sometimes, there will appear science fictions, as I am a fantasy fan of Liu Cixin (刘慈欣) and Ted Chiang.
