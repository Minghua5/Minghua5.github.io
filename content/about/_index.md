# About me 
I am Wu Minghua, a research assistant at BLC lab of PolyU, with a master's degree in **Linguistics** from Peking University, China.

My interests focus on the **computational and cognitive** aspects of language. I have experience in neural language models and neural experimental approaches, such as EEG and fMRI. 

I am looking for a Phd position to investigate how langugae is processed and acquired in human brains by combining both machine learning models and neuroimaging methods.

Sometimes, there will appear science fictions, as I am a fantasy fan of Liu Cixin (刘慈欣) and Ted Chiang.

# Projects

- **The neural foundations of online video learning**, HK, Assisted  
The project explores the impact of social factors on teacher-student neural coupling and the neural correlates of non-native learners in an online learning environment, by comparing neural responses, real-time visual allocation, and learning performance across distinct conditions

  

- **The embodiment of conceptual representations of LLMs**, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19103.pdf) HK, Assisted
The project investigated the embodiment of conceptual representations of LLMs, by comparing lexical conceptual representations between humans and ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on subjective ratings of various lexical conceptual features (e.g., emotional arousal, concreteness, haptic, etc.).

  

- **Development of Executive Functions (EF) of Children from 3 to 6 years**, SHANGHAI, Assisted
This is a longitudinal project that investigated the development of cognitive capacities (such as working memory and social cognition) and executive functions in children aged 4 to 6.



- **Semantics of Approximative Adverbs in Chinese**, SHANGHAI, Responsible
Collaborated with Dr. Hai Hu from Shanghai Jiaotong University, we examined how linguistic features (e.g., expectation,event probability, desirability, etc.) predicate people’s understanding of approximative adverbs.

  

- **The recognition of redundant negation in Mandarin Chinese**, MA THESIS, Responsible
This project investigated the linguistic characteristics of redundant negation and examined the ability of neural language models to understand redundant negation.

  

- **The argument of Chinese verb-resultative (V-R) constructions**, BA THESIS, Responsible
I studied the syntax and semantic features of subjects in the sentences having V-R as their predicates, with theories of event structure and metonymy



- **Effects of Language Backgrounds on Listeners’ Perception of Accented Speech**, NANJING, Responsible
The project was funded by the National Training Program of Innovation for Undergraduates.
We examined how native languages and exposure to accented speech influenced listeners’ perception and understanding of accented speech with an E-prime experiment on 42 subjects.
