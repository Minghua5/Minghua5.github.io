# About me 
Hello, welcome to my blog.

I am Wu Minghua, a research assistant at BLC lab of PolyU, with a master's degree in **Linguistics** from Peking University, China.

My interests focus on the **computational and cognitive** aspects of language. I have experience in neural language models and behavioral experimental approach, as well as some knowledge on EEG and fMRI. 

I am looking for a Phd position to investigate how langugae is processed and acquired in human brain by combining both machine learning models and neuroimaging methods.

To achieve such goal, I have been learning programming and cognitive science by myself. This blog is built to track my academic progress. Sometimes, there will appear science fictions, as I am a fantasy fan of Liu Cixin (刘慈欣) and Ted Chiang.

If you have any ideas, please feel free to contact me at <E0452947@u.nus.edu>.
